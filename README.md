### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
If you haven't uploaded code before, here is the command-line method (using Git Bash or VS Code terminal):

1.  **Initialize Git:**
    Open your project folder in your terminal and type:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add Your Files:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Commit Your Changes:**

    git commit -m "Initial commit - Completed Password Generator app"
    ```

4.  **Create a Repository on GitHub:**
    * Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in.
    * Click the **+** icon (top right) -> **New repository**.
    * Name it `password-generator`.
    * Click **Create repository**.

5.  **Connect and Push:**
    Copy the commands GitHub shows you under *"…or push an existing repository from the command line"* and paste them into your terminal. They usually look like this:
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/password-generator.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```
